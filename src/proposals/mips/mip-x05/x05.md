# MIP-X05: Reduce Safety Module Cooldown to 7 Days and Add Voting Requirement to Claim Rewards

## Summary

This proposal aims to bolster Moonwell's security posture through increased
governance participation and optimize the
[Moonwell Safety Module](https://docs.moonwell.fi/moonwell/moonwell-overview/stake#overview)
mechanics through two key changes:

1. Implementing a requirement that users must vote at least once in the last 30
   days to claim staking rewards
2. Reducing the unstaking cooldown period from 10 days to 7 days across
   supported networks

This proposal represents a foundational first step in increasing governance
participation and improving Moonwell's Safety Module, with potential for
additional enhancements based on community feedback and effectiveness.

## Motivation

Recent events in DeFi have highlighted the critical importance of active
governance participation in preventing governance attacks and hostile takeovers.
Specifically, this summer's
[governance attack on the Compound DAO](https://cointelegraph.com/news/key-takeaways-golden-boys-attack-compound-dao)
where a group known as the "Golden Boys" successfully passed a controversial
proposal during a period of low voting participation serves as a stark reminder
of the risks of governance inactivity.

Following extensive community discussion on the
[Moonwell Governance Forum](https://forum.moonwell.fi/t/increasing-governance-participation/1275),
this proposal implements two of the discussed changes while laying groundwork
for potential future enhancements. The community has suggested various
additional improvements that could be considered after evaluating the impact of
these initial changes, including but not limited to:

- Additional reward multipliers for consistent voters
- Further cooldown period optimizations
- Delegating stkWELL voting power to third party delegates to vote on a
  community member's behalf
- Additional governance participation incentives

## Specification

### Technical Implementation

The proposal will execute the following changes:

1. On Optimism:

   - Call `setCoolDownSeconds` on stkWELL contract
     (0xfB26A4947A38cb53e2D083c6490060CCCE7438c5)
   - New value: 604800 (7 days in seconds)

2. On Base:

   - Call `setCoolDownSeconds` on stkWELL contract
     (0xe66e3a37c3274ac24fe8590f7d84a2427194dc17)
   - New value: 604800 (7 days in seconds)

3. Frontend Implementation:
   - Add checks for voting history before enabling reward claims
   - Implement UI feedback for users who need to vote before claiming

Note: The Safety Module on Moonbeam will require a contract upgrade to update
the Cooldown Period and development is currently in progress. This contract
upgrade, like all deployed code on Moonwell, will be thoroughly audited by
Halborn Security and we aim to propose this change separately once the audit has
been completed in the coming weeks.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Based on community discussion, we've addressed key questions:

1. **Can users still stake/unstake without voting?**
   - Staking functions remain unrestricted
   - Unstaking is subject only to the standard cooldown period:
     - 7 days on Base and Optimism
     - 10 days on Moonbeam (until separate upgrade)
   - Voting status has no impact on staking or unstaking capabilities
2. **What happens to unclaimed rewards if a user hasn't voted?**

   - Rewards continue to accrue regardless of voting status
   - Users can claim after voting on any active onchain proposal
   - No rewards are lost; they're simply held until you participate in an
     onchain vote

3. **How will users know when to vote?**

   - Proposals are announced on
     [@MoonwellGov X/Twitter](https://x.com/MoonwellGov)
   - Proposal announcements are also posted in
     [Discord](https://discord.gg/moonwellfi) and
     [Telegram](https://t.me/moonwellfi) announcements channels
   - Boardroom provides regular governance updates on the Moonwell Governance
     Forum
   - Active proposals are surfaced on the Discovery and Governance pages in the
     [Moonwell app](https://moonwell.fi).
   - WELL stakers attempting to claim rewards will be linked to active proposals
     when attempting to claim rewards from the
     [staking page](https://moonwell.fi/stake/base) of the Moonwell app.

4. **Will voting "abstain" allow me to claim Safety Module staking rewards**
   - Yes, any tallied vote within the past 30 days, whether it be Aye, Nay, and
     Abstain, will allow for you to claim your Safety Module staking rewards.

## Timeline

- Voting Period: 3 days
- Implementation:
  - Immediate upon successful execution of MIP-X05 for Optimism and Base
    networks
  - Moonbeam implementation to follow in 1-2 weeks after Safety Module contract
    uplift, successful audit, and passage of separate governance vote

## Additional Notes

- Gas costs for voting on Base will be sponsored through Coinbase Smart Wallet
- Future proposals may build upon this foundation based on community feedback
  and observed effectiveness

## Voting Options

- **For (Aye)**: Vote in favor of implementing the reduced cooldown period and
  voting requirement for reward claims
- **Against (Nay)**: Vote against implementing these changes, maintaining
  current cooldown period and reward claim mechanics
- **Abstain**: Participate in voting while remaining neutral on the proposal
